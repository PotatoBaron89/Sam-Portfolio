Description: This site functions as my professional portfolio. It is the first iteration and will receive updates as my technical understanding and capabilities continue to improve.

Purpose: The purpose of the portfolio is to serve as a means for me to showcase my work to others - in particular potential employers. I intend to use it to increase my visibility and presence as best I can.

Functionality / Features: Currently, as per stipulated requirements, the site is divided into four separate html pages instead of a single page. At a later date I will go through and change it into a single page scrollable website instead.
Currently, the site features:

1. A nav menu at the top allowing the user to quickly navigate between different pages of the website. This is common to all four pages.
2. It includes some subtle animations as I didn't want them to be too distracting to the user. Almost all the animations only play on load. The exception being hover effects on nav items to better convey that they are clickable, and the social nav bar in the footer of the page with links to my relevant social pages.
3. The sites content includes:
   1. Home page, which includes basic information about me, and a featured blog and project of mine (once I have my own to fill them anyway).
      1. Home page also includes my personal resume.
   2. Portfolio page: A catalogued list of all my work, with a screenshot and a brief description, as well as tags including the tech stacks used.
   3. Blog: A list of blogs that I have found noteworthy. They include full reference to the author. All of these blogs will eventually be replaced by own blogs (I haven't written any yet).
   4. Contact page: A simple page that includes a list of ways that one can get into contact with me.

Target Audience: As mentioned earlier, my target audience at this point is largely potential employees, but this will grow to include any other people in the tech industry that are interested, potential clients and any potential visitors to the blog.

Tech Stack: For now, the tech stack is purely HTML and CSS.
